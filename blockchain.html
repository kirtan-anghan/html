    <p>A <b>blockchain</b> is a type of Digital Ledger Technology (DLT) that consists of growing list of records, called
        blocks, that are securely linked together using cryptography.<sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup> Each block contains a
        cryptographic
        hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where
        data nodes are represented by leafs). The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was
        created. Since each block contains information about the block previous to it, they effectively form a chain
        (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently,
        blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be
        altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks.

        <mark> Blockchains are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P)</mark> computer network for use as a public
        distributed
        ledger, where nodes collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate new transaction
        blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be
        considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance.[5]
        <br>
        The blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in
        2008[6] to serve as the public distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on previous
        work by Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer.<sup>[7]</sup> The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains
        unknown to
        date. The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the
        double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has
        inspired other applications<sup>[3][2]</sup> and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used
        by
        cryptocurrencies. The blockchain may be considered a type of payment rail.<sup>[8]</sup>
        <br>
        Private blockchains have been proposed for business use. Computerworld called the marketing of such privatized
        blockchains without a proper security model "snake oil";[9] however, others have argued that permissioned
        blockchains, if carefully designed, may be more decentralized and therefore more secure in practice than
        permissionless ones.<sup>[4][10]</sup>

    <h2>Structure & Design</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>A <u>blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and often public, digital ledger </u> of records called
        blocks that are used to record transactions across many computers so that any involved block cannot be altered
        retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks.<sup>[3][21]</sup> This allows the participants
        to verify
        and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively.<sup>[22]</sup> A blockchain database is
        managed
        autonomously using a peer-to-peer network and a distributed timestamping server. They are authenticated by mass
        collaboration powered by collective self-interests.<sup>[23]</sup> Such a design facilitates robust workflow
        where
        participants' uncertainty regarding data security is marginal. The use of a blockchain removes the
        characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was
        transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double-spending. A blockchain has been described as
        a value-exchange protocol.<sup>[24]</sup> A blockchain can maintain title rights because, when properly set up
        to detail
        the exchange agreement, it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance</p>

    <p>Logically, a blockchain can be seen as consisting of several layers:<sup>[25]</sup></p>
    <ul>
        <li>infrastructure (hardware)</li>
        <li>networking (node discovery, information propagation<sup>[26]</sup> and verification)</li>
        <li>consensus (proof of work, proof of stake)</li>
        <li>data (blocks, transactions)</li>
        <li>application (smart contracts/decentralized applications,if applicable)</li>
    </ul>
